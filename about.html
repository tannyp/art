                        <p ><br>Captivating Canada with his nuanced movement and heartfelt performances, Tanjot Panesar is a well known choreographer in both Toronto and Vancouver, and is recognized for his innovation in designing and teaching movement.<br><br>

                         From opening up for 3x platinum recording artist, Tory Lanez, at Toronto’s largest nightclub concert destination to choreographing for 2.5+ million streams recording - New York based singer, Rajan905, to staring as a principal dancer on CBC’s episodic “RUN THE BURBS”, Tanjot proves himself as multi-faceted and hardworking in various areas.<br><br>

                         Currently, Tanjot has taught at both Studio North Toronto and Studio North Vancouver, Canada’s leading dance studio owned by Carmen and Scott Forsyth. Some of his other teaching credits include Prestige Studios Toronto, Underground Dance Centre, Ottawa’s Flava Factory, Vancouver’s A3 District, and a Canada-wide mindful movement workshop tour - an initiative started for dancers and non dancers to experience a holistic approach to movement using approaches inspired by qigong and Dance Movement Therapy (DMT).<br><br>

                         Using his training in movement styles such as hip-hop, popping - street style, contemporary, qigong and bhangra, he has found a way to integrate authenticity in movement that is driven by breathwork. Some mentors that Tanjot has worked with and has shaped his mindset, method and movement are Galen Hooks, Sorah Yang, Markus Pe Benito, and Joe Tuliao.
                        
                         Tanjot continues to seek new and diverse cultures to help inspire his next creative endeavors and impactful art. <br><br>

                <p class="testi-pic">“Tanjot facilitated a space for us to play, explore, and ground ourselves at our own pace and comfort. Through choreography, improvisation, and practices brought from mindfulness, we experienced a class to nourish the body, mind, and soul." <b>- KINAJ</b></p>
                <br>
                <p class="testi-pic">“From the minute I stepped into Tanjot’s class, it was clear that he was there to bring out the very best out of every dancer. His teaching style pushes students to challenge themselves creatively, while uplifting their fellow classmates. In doing so, he creates a space in which people feel safe to be vulnerable & expressive in their movement. He is someone who seeks to build community, and someone who deeply cares about those he meets. Tanjot is an incredible community leader, teacher, and mentor, and I’m so grateful to have met him.” - <b>Alycea Wood</b></p>
