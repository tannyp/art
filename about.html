                        <p ><br>Tanjot Panesar is a movement artist and dance educator from Milton, Ontario whose mission is to share authenticity in his dance experiences with others. He began learning bhangra, a Punjabi dance style at the age of five, and continued to immerse himself in Punjabi culture. Throughout his dancing journey he became fascinated with expressing his artistry, telling stories and thus began training in other movement styles such as hip-hop grooves, popping, contemporary fusion, qi-gong and improvised movement to help gain an appreciation of what has come before his time and to expand his toolset.<br><br>


                        In his early teens, Tanjot came across meditation and breathwork as a means to strengthen the quality of his own life and find a deeper sense belonging. In doing so, he has been developing a niche style of movement that is authentic to himself and his life experiences which are composed of dramatic visuals and movement driven by breathwork. In the development of his work, he has been inspired and has worked with Galen Hooks and Markus Pe Benito to refine his craft.<br><br>


                        At his core, Tanjot is a speaker and educator. He has previously directed Origins - a competitive dance team in the local post-secondary scene, taught and facilitated his "Mindful Movement Workshop Tour" in Vancouver, Toronto, Mississauga, Hamilton, and Waterloo. Most recently, he has presented a stage piece called “BIRDS” at FeverAfterDark 2022, telling a story about a pursuit of attaining higher levels of freedom.<br><br>

                <p class="testi-pic">“Tanjot facilitated a space for us to play, explore, and ground ourselves at our own pace and comfort. Through choreography, improvisation, and practices brought from mindfulness, we experienced a class to nourish the body, mind, and soul." <b>- KINAJ</b></p>
                <br>
                <p class="testi-pic">“From the minute I stepped into Tanjot’s class, it was clear that he was there to bring out the very best out of every dancer. His teaching style pushes students to challenge themselves creatively, while uplifting their fellow classmates. In doing so, he creates a space in which people feel safe to be vulnerable & expressive in their movement. He is someone who seeks to build community, and someone who deeply cares about those he meets. Tanjot is an incredible community leader, teacher, and mentor, and I’m so grateful to have met him.” - <b>Alycea Wood</b></p>
